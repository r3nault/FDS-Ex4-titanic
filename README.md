# FDS-Ex4-titanic
Springboard: Foundations of Data Science - Exercise 4 - Data Viz - Titanic.R

# Getting Started
This R code runs in RStudio using R version 3.4.1.
You need the dplyr and ggplot2 libraries installed.
You need to download titanic_clean.csv which is used in the code.

# Running the Code
Run Titanic.R line by line to see my work!
The exercise was coded on DataCamp using its web-based R environment.
The 'titanic' data set in the exercise is not available locally in RStudio so instead I have re-used the "clean" data set from Chapter 3.1 Exercise 2. This means I have approximately double the rows of data compared to the online version, but I did need to clean one additional row (removed).
